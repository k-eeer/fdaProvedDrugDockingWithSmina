It's a script to screen which drug molecule fits protein molecule better.

The screening method is reffered to "docking".

We choose position between structure units as fitting site, for intervening protien's function only structure information.

For test, we pick random 10 drug molecules to calculate fitting score to 3 possible states of the protein.

You can revise loop condition to run complete process. It might take 3-4 or more days.
